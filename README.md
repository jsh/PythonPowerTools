# PythonPowerTools

These tools are ports of the BSD utilities from the
PerlPowerTools (PPT) project, started by Tom Christiansen in February, 1999,
and currently maintained by brian d foy.

The Perl sources are drawn from the [PPT GitHub repository](https://github.com/briandfoy/PerlPowerTools.git) .
Default license for each tool is Perl's Artistic License 2.0, which can be found in LICENSE.md.

The steward for this license is the Perl and Raku Foundation.
I've copied the license from [this URL](https://www.perlfoundation.org/artistic-license-20.html),
adding markdown to the title and subheads by hand to make it look a little nicer.

At brian's suggestion, I've adopted this license for the project as a whole.
If any individual tool has a different license, it is specified in the source of that tool.

## TODO

I'm going to try to create a first draft of each tool through a direct conversion by an AI assistant.
Will that work? Who knows.

***If you try to use a Python version of one of the tools, assume it's completely untested.***

The PPT repository testing directory, `PPT/t` only lists individual tests for 25 of the 125 tools in `PPT/bin`,
so test-driven-development (TDD) is impractical.

I have no plan to add tests until I have created drafts of all the tools.

*Caveat emptor.*
